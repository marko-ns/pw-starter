This is a template (project starter) for making automated tests without spending a lot of time setting things up using Playwright and JavaScript. <br> <br>
The command for running tests is (headed mode and using only Google Chrome): <br> 
**ENV=.env.staging npx playwright test exampleTest.spec.js --headed --project="chromium"**
